            Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised precise definition of what a tree is,
             either botanically or in common language.[1][2]
             In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of 
             an elongated stem, or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches 
             at some distance above the ground.[3] Trees are also typically defined by height,
             [4] with smaller plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs,[5] 
             so the minimum height of a tree is only loosely defined.[4] Large herbaceous 
             plants such as papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.[2][6]</b>
